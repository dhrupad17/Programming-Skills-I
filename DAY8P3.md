# Find the Difference
---
- ## Question:
> You are given two strings s and t.
> 
> String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.
> 
> Return the letter that was added to t.
---
- ## Example:
> Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
> 
> Output: "e"
> 
> Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.

- ## Solution:
**Code :**
```java
public class Solution {
    public char findTheDifference(String s, String t) {
        char sum_s = 'a';
	char sum_t = 'a';
	int i = 0;
	for (; i < s.length(); i++) {
            sum_s += s.charAt(i);
            sum_t += t.charAt(i);
	}
	sum_t += t.charAt(i);
	return (char) (sum_t - sum_s);
    }
}
